BLA: a NEURON network model
########################################

This is a large-scale biophysical network model of the Basolateral Amygdala based on the framework provided by Marianne Bezaire's model of the hippocampal CA1 area.

# Defining a model

Defining a model requires defining properties of single cells, synapses, connectivity, and stimulation. These are done in the following files:

1) ./datasets/cellnumbers_XX.dat

2) ./datasets/conndata_XX.dat

etc.
